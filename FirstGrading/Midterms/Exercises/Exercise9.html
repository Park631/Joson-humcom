                      According to a report in Euromonitor International, chocolate sales growth is predicted to rise by eight percent in North America, with an increasingly diet-conscious U.S. market set to remain the food group's biggest market, accounting for 15 percent of confectionery sales in 2018. Francisco Redruello, senior food analyst at Euromonitor International, said the results show consumers are increasingly willing to pay more for indulging in chocolate.

                      According to Research and Markets, "The Europe confectionery market is expected to reach USD 83 billion by 2023, witnessing a stable CAGR of 3 %, during the forecast period. Confectionery consumption volume in the region surpassed 5,875 million Kg in 2017, moving at steady volume growth rate. Western Europe dominates the chocolate sale followed by central and Eastern Europe. Increased demand for higher quality cocoa products and premium chocolate accelerated confectionery sale in Europe."
