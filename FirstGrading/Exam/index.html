    <p>Five top trends for 2021 in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) for staying ahead of the curve.<br> What is important for being effective for applying algorithms in coding to utilize data to solve problems?<br></p>

    <p><b>Blackchain</b>, is a technology that uses a sequential set of transactions leaving a defined register of events and process for combining tasks.<br> Fusing AI/ML and blockchain for data solutions is coming.</p>

    <p><b>Cloud</b>, is scalable and virtual environments.<br> These are available to set users with no physical location or provision requirement.<br> Cloud creates a different model for IT and data services by not restricting architecture by physical requirements.<br></p>
    
    <p><b>Ethical Artificial Intelligence</b>, is a field, study, implementation of framework for limiting or eliminating bias in algorithms. <br> This involves evaluating a solution for data use and implementation for cultural and social impact.  <br> </p>
    

    <p><b>Interoperability,</b>, using APIs and libraries together through replication or scripting across stacks for easy implementations. <br> Having reusable and expandable blocks for coding across platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, SAP, Snowflake, and more. <br> </p>
    
    <p><b>Security</b>, keeping data safe through stewardship. <br> Both innovation and workflow will be a topic for 2021 to enhance security methods for specialized data services based on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to differentiate from software development norms.<br> </p>
    
    <p>The way to stay ahead is to know the list of technologies that touch a domain and achieve proficiency in them for incorporation into tasks to maintain productivity. The five themes for 2021 for maintaining relevance in AI/ML: Blockchain, Cloud, Ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI), Interoperability, and Security (Cybersecurity).</p>

    <p>Institutions, especially in health care, are working to lower the exposure of Covid-19 to patients and workers. <br>Many private and public practices have started implementing more telehealth offerings such as doctor-patient video chats,<br> A.I. avatar-based diagnostics, and no-contact-based medication delivery.</p>
    
    <p>Telehealth visits have surged by 50 percent compared with pre-pandemic levels.<br> IHS Technology predicted that 70 million Americans would use telehealth by 2020. Since then,<br> Forrester Research predicted the number of U.S. virtual care visits will reach almost a billion early in 2021.</p>
    
    <p>Teladoc Health, Amwell, Livongo Health, One Medical, and Humana are some of the public companies offering telehealth services <br> to meet the current needs.Startups are not far behind. Startups like MDLive, MeMD, iCliniq, K Health, 98point6, Sense.ly, and Eden <br> Health have also contributed toward meeting the growing needs in 2020, and will continue offering creative solutions in 2021. Beyond telehealth,<br> in 2021 we can expect to see health care advancements in biotech and A.I., as well as machine learning opportunities <br> (example: Suki AI) to support diagnosis, admin work, and robotic health care.</p>
